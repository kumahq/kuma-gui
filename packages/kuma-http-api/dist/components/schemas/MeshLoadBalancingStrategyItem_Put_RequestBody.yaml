                            The table size for Maglev hashing. Maglev aims for “minimal disruption”
                            rather than an absolute guarantee. Minimal disruption means that when
                            the set of upstream hosts change, a connection will likely be sent
                            to the same upstream as it was before. Increasing the table size reduces
                            the amount of disruption. The table size must be prime number limited to 5000011.
                            If it is not specified, the default is 65537.

                        Random selection avoids bias towards the host in the set that comes after a failed host.

                                  Weight of the tag used for load balancing. The bigger the weight the bigger the priority.
                                  Percentage of local traffic load balanced to tag is computed by dividing weight by sum of weights from all tags.
                                  For example with two affinity tags first with weight 80 and second with weight 20,
                                  then 80% of traffic will be redirected to the first tag, and 20% of traffic will be redirected to second one.
                                  Setting weights is not mandatory. When weights are not set control plane will compute default weight based on list order.
                                  Default: If you do not specify weight we will adjust them so that 90% traffic goes to first tag, 9% to next, and 1% to third and so on.
