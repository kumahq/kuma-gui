  MeshMultiZoneService provides global load balancing and service discovery across multiple zones in a multi-zone mesh deployment. It aggregates MeshServices from different zones by label selectors, creating a unified service endpoint with automatic VIP assignment and hostname generation for cross-zone communication and failover.
  MeshMultizoneServices are only created on global
